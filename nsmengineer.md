1. this is a numbered list
1. typing 1 and period again under the list, would turn this into the next item list

to add links, use square brackets as such [https://google.com], or use an alias with [google](https://google.com)

local links is the same but add a local drive path

for code enhancement, use the slanted apostrophe near the tilda. `sudo apt-get @lif3`

to type a codeblock, use three of the slanted apostrophes like you did for the highlighted code:

```
ls -l
```

to create a  table: add pipes for each column, and enter for a new row.
|Column 1|Column 2|Column 3|Column 4|
|---|---|---|---|
| row 1| row 2| row 3| row 4|
| row 5| row 6| row 7| row 8|

```

        the dots before and after state that there is code before and after the block
    ...
